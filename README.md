# Chess-Python-Project

Statistical analysis of the Lichess dataset (chess game) using Python

Chess is a complex and strategic game that has been played for centuries, and with the advent of technology, it is now possible to collect and analyze large amounts of data on chess games. The dataset used in this analysis contains information on over twenty thousand games, including information on the players, the moves made, and the outcome of the game.

The aim of this study is to uncover patterns and extract valuable insights from the data of chess players. The approach is divided into three phases: preprocessing, which encompasses the cleaning and organization of the data. Analysis, where sophisticated statistical methodologies and visualization tools are utilized to reveal patterns in the data. Finally, a holistic workflow is established to streamline the execution of all steps in a cohesive manner. Initially, the preprocessing and analysis were conducted using Jupyter Notebook, but were subsequently separated into three Python files named: 'preprocessing.py', 'analysis.py', and 'workflow.py'.

This project is intended for chess enthusiasts, data scientists, and anyone interested in learning more about how data analysis can be used to understand complex systems like chess.

Note: Please ensure to clear the contents of the "results" folder, as well as the "preprocessed_dataset.csv" inside the "data" folder within the project's compressed file, before running the Python scripts.
